# Mass Shootings Project
The Mass Shootings Project is a project I worked on in order to gain experience and learn more about ETL.

## Goals of The Project:
1. Data extraction using Snowflake and GCP.
2. Data Processing using SQL and Python.
3. Data analysis of mass shooters attributes using SQL and Power BI.

## Tools and Software Languages:
1. Google Cloud Platform
2. Snowflake
3. Python (Pandas and Snowpark)
4. SQL
5. Power BI

## Data
1. Mass Shooting Database via The Violence Project

1. schemas - SQL, schemas for the tables I used in my project.
2. data_upload - SQL, uploading data from GCP and creating dataframes.
3. fix_victims, fix_signs, fix_firearms, fix_date_and_loc - Python, fixing lines that caused errors and inserting them to the dataframes.
4. transform_data - SQL, cleaning and fixing data.
5. data_analysis - SQL, exploring the data.
